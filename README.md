# Sentiment-Analysis-with-LSTM
Even though the use of a pre-trained word embedding matrix was proven to deliver very good results with a very small dataset, the model that I previously built did not take word sequences into consideration. In this experiment, I would like to explore how RNN-LSTM can be used to learn sequences and produce better models for text classification. To do so, I explored the performance of various models with different configuations.
